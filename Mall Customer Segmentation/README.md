# Mall Customer Segmentation 

K-means Clustering algorithm is used in this project (with n_clusters = 5 and init = ‘kmeans++’) to analyze and form clusters of customers based on their annual income and spending score features.

### Clustering Analysis

**Cluster 5:**
High Income, High Spending Score - Target these customers by sending new product alerts which would lead to an increase in the revenue collected by the mall as they are loyal customers.

**Cluster 2:**
High Income, Low Spending Score - Target these customers by asking the feedback and advertising the product in a better way to convert them into Cluster 5 customers.

**Cluster 1:**
Average Income, Average Spending Score - May or may not target these groups of customers based on the policy of the mall.

**Cluster 4:**
Low Income, High Spending Score - Can target these set of customers by providing them with Low-cost EMI's, etc.

**Cluster 3:**
Low Income, Low Spending Score - Don't target these customers since they have less income and need to save money.
